Recently I had the joy of reading Homesick by Jennifer Croft (I can
definetly recommend it), however, although somewhat unrelated, I also
had the amazing experience of learning about my school district's new
policy concerning "mature" books. Around America more and more "mega 
conservatives" have begun to reach out to their school boards in order 
to fight against "mature" content in their kids books. Of course none of
the content they're fighting is really mature, instead they are fighting
books that they feel go against their beliefs. While I do believe there 
is some merit to trying to keep books that are essentially smut of
library shelves, it doesn't take a genius to see what these parents
really want. They want to see "woke" ideas out of their kids books; 
things like gay people existing or ideas that go against god. I've
mostly watched from the sidelines, up until now...

# Some Context

I'm in my junior year of high school and with that I have had the joy of
taking my first of the AP english classes (I think its AP lit, but 
honestly not 100% sure). Surprisingly, it hasn't been too bad. I've had 
my fair share of somewhat dissapointing essay grades, but besides that 
the class has been smooth sailing. I would probably say out of all the 
classes I'm taking this year it's one of the easier ones. Still this 
story isn't about the class itself. Our teacher likes to have us read 
in class from time to time and recently he decided we would take a class 
trip to the library to pick out some memoirs to read. You see part of 
the AP lit test is writing an argumentative essay where you have to 
write based off of a prompt using your own evidence. So our teacher 
wanted us to get some books that would help add to our toolbelt of 
evidence that we can use on our essay. So we went to the library and I 
shopped around until I found a book called *Homesick*. Now I'll be 
upfront, I mostly picked the book out because I thought the cover was 
cool. Some people may say that there is something wrong with that; I 
think it's totally fine (maybe I'll go into it more some other time). 
Nonetheless everything was pretty normal up to this point. This was 
actually my first time (I think) checking out a book from my schools 
library, so I was kinda psyched to be venturing into new territory. It 
was only about a week from then when things turned *weird*. My mother, 
a former teacher, likes to keep up-to-date with things related to 
school and
