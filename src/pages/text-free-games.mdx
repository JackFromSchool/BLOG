I'm currently in my junior year of high school and with that, I've had to sort of
put things in gear a bit more; essentially I don't play games as much as I used
to. Don't get me wrong I still love to hop on a multiplayer game when I have
free time but I just can't find the time to play solo games anymore, and it
just outright sucks. Maybe that's just part of growing up and I'll eventually
drift away from gaming altogether. I mean I know of adults that
play games but it's not a very high number. Beyond streamers most adults I see
talk about games like they're some distant memory, as though everyone should
grow out of them. Take the recent HBO show The Last of Us: great show, but
the people cast for it had never even heard of the game. While I know that's
just one example, and countless others prove me wrong (like
Henry Caville, in The Witcher), I still believe that video games kind of
fade away as you get older. Not to sound like an old man, but even I don't find
the same enjoyment I once did playing games. I remember I could go for hours
and hours on end playing Minecraft all night, but now I don't even think I
could get past the first night without being bored. I just think it has to do
with a shift in priorities. Back when I was like 10 I didn't have shit to do
all day, so playing games until my brains rot away was perfectly fine. Now
though, I have other things I could be doing, and so playing games just makes
me feel like a piece of shit sometimes. After all, for example, I could be
working on this blog instead of gaming. Still though even as my thoughts change
and I sort of fall away from gaming I still feel this pain in being productive
rather than playing games. First of all, I have a ton of games just sitting in
my library waiting to be played, but secondly, I want to see what those
games have to offer. In the end that is the one thing that has kept me excited
about gaming more than anything else, it's the stories that have to offer.
<br/>
Even back when I was free to play games all day every day I always levitated
towards games that had a story aspect. For example, I loved to play Minecraft
even though it wasn't inherently story based, it had a lot of room for you to
create your own stories. Eventually, though I found out about games like Portal
(one of my all-time favorites), which were built upon telling
incredible stories, and I fell in love. I still remember the deep dives I would
go into when it came to finding out more about the lore in Portal; I would
spend hours watching Youtube videos on all kinds of theories people had come up
with. Then of course I would stumble upon Youtube channels like Game Theory,
which were like crack to my story-loving brain. I would watch videos on games I
hadn't ever played or had any interest in, purely because I wanted to know what
kind of story they had to tell. Even today I've found that some of my most fond
memories in gaming came from unravelling stories. My all-time most favorite game
the Outer Wilds (which I must do a blog post for someday) is completely built
upon unraveling a story through exploration. Now I know that all this isn't
exactly some special trait that no other people have, I know plenty of other
people who love deep dive lore videos and all the like, but I do feel that it
is that love for storytelling that has played a big part in my interest in
videogames. 
<br/>
Now it may seem like I've gone on some big outrageously long tangent--although
in many ways, I have--but I wanted to point something out. Every one of
the games I mentioned primarily gets its point across through the use of
some sort of dialogue, whether it be spoken or text-based. However that kind of
approach can often get in the way of gameplay and I've found that there is an
alternative to that sort of clutch, and I found it in a game I played
recently...

# The Game
I found the game *Hyper Light Drifter* on a regular hunt through Steam as I pondered
whether or not I wanted to buy a new game. However, the reason I ended up buying it
was because there was something oddly familiar about it. Although I'm sure I'd 
heard the name Hyper Light Drifter somewhere before from some game reviewer, the 
reason it seemed so familiar was that I had listened to the soundtrack before; I 
had like one song on an old playlist. However despite never really listening to the 
whole thing I did enjoy the little bit I did listen to, and upon closer
inspection, 
I found out the artist who created the soundtrack made the soundtrack for Fez, 
a game I had played and loved. Now I could go on a huge tangent about how I believe 
the number one reason you should buy a game is if it has a good soundtrack, but I'll 
save some time and just say that if a game has a good soundtrack, I'm going to buy it.
Plus I loved the art style, and the trailer which showed off some stunning 
scenery. So, I went ahead and purchased the game so I could pick it up sometime over 
the weekend, without any clue what I was getting into.

## First Few Seconds
Holy shit the beginning of Hyper Light Drifter is something else. Unlike most games 
where you get a nice little cutscene with some dialogue or text describing what's 
going on, Hyper Light starts with an absolute mind-fuck. It has absolutely zero
dialogue (finally getting to the point) and honestly leaves you with way more
questions than any game probably should. However I still absolutely loved it. I
have played a lot of outstanding games but none of them have ever really left
me confused, the way a movie like, for example, Tenent has. I loved
Tenent because it leaves you with that *good* feeling of confusion; the kind
where you're invested in what's going on and actively trying to untangle things
in your head. Although I've played games that move me to understand
new things about life and see the world from whole new perspectives, nothing
has every made me confused in that kind of way. Now I could go into tons of
detail describing said cutscene, but instead I'll just link it and say, please
go watch this top-notch cutscene.

## The Rest
Now I know this may be utterly shocking, but Hyper Light Drifter is more than
just an opening cutscene. It's an 8-hour ride (according to howlongtobeat.com)
that continues with its no-text trend. Now this may make it seem as though it
is some sort of glorified walking simulator, after all, how could a game with
no dialogue direct its players to do anything? The way that Hyper Light gets
past this is actually by having a form dialogue. It isn't normal dialogue, but
rather NPCs their dialogue as pictures. At first, it's incredibly confusing
trying to figure out what is going on. I kept expecting some sort of magical
fairy to come out of
nowhere and just tell me exactly what to do and where to go; after all every
game in existence has followed that troupe. Instead, I started to adapt, almost
like a blind man, and better understand what was being presented to me. Rather
than expecting some book or tablet to appear and tell me what was going on, I
started to try and actively unpack what was happening around me. I'll admit
that doesn't mean I figured out the actual meaning of the game, but it's still
interesting that I was able to come to some sort of conclusion. It sparks an
idea, that maybe all forms of media with text or dialogue are doing some sort
of disservice to what they're being accompanied with. If you're spending all of
your time listening to what people are talking about on a TV show, chances are
you'll miss the nuance that may be present in a certain scene. After all, there
are plenty of studies that show humans are unable of multitasking,
wouldn't that mean that handicap affects all the times when our minds are torn
between two opposing things? Maybe I'm reading into this whole experience too
much, and dialogue isn't that distracting when it comes to things like
film or television, but also maybe I'm not. I think that more movies
should try an approach that only engages with one part of our brains because, after
all, art has been like that for decades. Books, paintings, and music never
intertwined in the way they have up until, what, 100 years ago. Sure there was
theater, but that medium thrived on having simple sets that could be easily
moved around. I'm not trying to undermine the hard work of people who spend
years crafting incredible sets for theaters, but a different level of detail
can oftentimes be put into a set made for TV or film. The fact of the matter
is, we live in a time where media has formed into these massive conglomerates
that encompass all the senses, and in many ways that has pushed art to
astounding new places. However, it has also limited us in ways that go
unnoticed until you a step back and get rid of the "fluff".

## A Caveat
Now it's time for me to be brutally honest. There is something I have been
neglecting to mention that sort of undermines my argument. Hyper Light Drifter
is not completely void of any text. Throughout the game there are a series of
stone tablets you can find that contain text in a different language, completely
made up by the game's creators. If you can figure out how to translate these
tablets, then the game does technically contain text. However this by no means
uproots what I have to say. Simply playing the game without any dialogue
made me appreciate and understand the art more presently. While it may not be a
"text-free game" in the purest form of the word, it still followed that
principle in a way that made me notice. After all, I didn't even realize that
these tablets existed until after I had finished the game. Maybe if it was
incredibly obvious then I wouldn't be able to call Hyper Light a text-free
game, but as far as I can say it is still text free. It still went out of its
way to make a large sacrifice in its storytelling techniques, and for that, it
deserves some credit.

# Some Final Remarks
Although I'm sure other titles exist out there that have gotten rid of text and
dialogue from their list of storytelling tools, Hyper Light Drifter is the
game that made me take notice. In the last few years I've tried to move away
from simply enjoying video games, television, and film, and instead trying to
look at them as pieces of art that have their own things to say about the
world. While it's completely fine to take these forms of media at face value, a
lot can be gained when you try to understand them fully. And, this new outlook
towards art has led me to a new appreciation for those that do something new
with their respective medium. Art is about taking risks, and after all is said
and done, wouldn't rather be able to say you changed the game?
